# Advanced learning for text and graph data ALTEGRAD

Practical work and projects from the Advanced learning for text and graph data (ALTEGRAD) course I took during my first semester in the MVA master's program at ENS Paris-Saclay.

The ALTEGRAD course (28 hours) aims at providing an overview of state-of-the-art ML and AI methods for text and graph data with a significant focus on applications. Each session will comprise two hours of lecture followed by two hours of programming sessions.
